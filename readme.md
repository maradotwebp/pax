PAX is the solution to modern modpack development for Minecraft, usable both alone and in a team. It supports Forge & Fabric, can be version controlled with git, and one command is all you need in order to upload your pack to Curseforge.

*The following features are implemented*:

- ⌨️ **CLI interface** for quick actions
- 🔎 **Search & Install** for Curseforge mods
- 📥 **Updating one mod or the whole modpack**, automatically selecting the best available version
- 👁️ **Mod Information** (compability & whether an update is available) at one glance (see above picture ;) )
- 💾 **Easily diffable files** for ease of working with git

*The following features are on the roadmap for the following weeks*:

- 🤖 **Continous Integration**
  - You push your project to Github/Gitlab and a runner automatically builds your modpack and uploads it to Curseforge. It's magic, woohoo!
- 🔃 **Minecraft Development Environment**
  - Sync file changes between your project and your minecraft launcher, so you don't have to import your modpack every time you make a change.

## Usage
